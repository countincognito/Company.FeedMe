# Company.FeedMe

This is a simple example of the "Feed Me" Pattern for event-driven microservices.

It requires a local installation of [Seq](https://getseq.net/) for logging, and a minimum of version 5.6 of the [Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator).

To try it out simple run the **Test.InProc.RestApi**, but be sure to start the Storage Emulator first.
